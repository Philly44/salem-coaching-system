# FERPA Compliance and PII Security Audit Report
**Salem University Coaching Evaluation System**  
**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security & Compliance Officer  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 70% (Improved - Critical Issues Being Addressed)

## Executive Summary

The Salem University Coaching System has made significant progress in security implementation. Recent improvements include enhanced PII sanitization (replacing last names with initials), removal of all console logging, and complete removal of email functionality. However, the system still requires encryption, rate limiting, and consent mechanisms for full FERPA compliance.

## ðŸŽ‰ Recent Improvements (July 23, 2025)

1. **Enhanced PII Sanitization**
   - Last names replaced with initials (John Smith â†’ John S.)
   - Complex name patterns handled (hyphenated, titles, suffixes)
   - Additional PII removed (SSN, phone, email, addresses)
   - Both API endpoints now sanitize consistently

2. **Console Logging Eliminated**
   - All transcript logging removed from frontend
   - No sensitive data exposed in browser console

3. **Email Functionality Removed**
   - All email sending code deleted
   - No hardcoded recipients
   - Reduced third-party exposure

## ðŸš¨ Critical Compliance Violations

### 1. **Unencrypted PII Transmission**
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Issue:** All student transcripts and evaluation data transmitted as plain text
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/evaluate/route.ts`, `/src/app/api/evaluate-stream/route.ts`
- **Impact:** Violates FERPA requirement for secure transmission of educational records

### 2. ~~**Console Logging of Sensitive Data**~~ âœ… RESOLVED
- **Risk Level:** ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** ~~Student transcripts logged to browser console~~
- **Resolution:** All console.log statements containing PII have been removed
- **Impact:** No longer exposing PII in browser developer tools

### 3. **Hardcoded Email Recipients**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Evaluation results automatically sent to hardcoded email addresses
- **Status:** RESOLVED - All email functionality has been removed
- **Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of student records to predetermined recipients

### 4. **Third-Party Data Sharing Without Consent**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (Reduced from CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Transcripts sent to Anthropic API without student consent mechanism
- **Improvement:** Transcripts now sanitized - last names replaced with initials, PII removed
- **Location:** Both API routes now sanitize before sending to Anthropic
- **Remaining Issue:** Still requires explicit consent mechanism for FERPA compliance

### 5. **No Security Headers**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Missing essential security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Location:** `/next.config.ts` - Empty configuration
- **Impact:** Vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, and other client-side attacks

### 6. **Authentication Token in LocalStorage**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Auth tokens stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS
- **Location:** `/src/components/AuthWrapper.tsx:16,29,41`
- **Impact:** Tokens can be stolen via JavaScript injection

### 7. **No Rate Limiting**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** API endpoints lack rate limiting protection
- **Impact:** Vulnerable to abuse, data harvesting, and DoS attacks

## âœ… Implemented Security Measures

### 1. **Authentication System** (Partially Compliant)
- Token-based authentication implemented
- All API endpoints require valid tokens
- User management system with roles (admin, advisor, viewer)
- Audit logging of access attempts

### 2. **Enhanced PII Sanitization** (Significantly Improved)
- Last names replaced with initials (John Smith â†’ John S.)
- Complex names handled (Dr. Jennifer Smith-Johnson â†’ Dr. Jennifer S.-J.)
- SSNs, phones, emails, addresses, DOBs, IDs removed
- Email addresses partially masked (john@example.com â†’ j***@example.com)
- Both API endpoints sanitize consistently
- Validation and audit logging of sanitization
- Location: `/src/utils/sanitizeTranscript.ts`

### 3. **Activity Logging**
- Basic audit trail implementation
- Logs user access and actions
- Location: `/src/lib/auth.ts:95-107`

## ðŸ“Š Detailed Findings

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Input:** Student-advisor transcripts entered via web form
2. **Processing:** 
   - Minimal sanitization (last name removal only)
   - Full transcript sent to Anthropic API
   - No encryption in transit within application
3. **Output:** 
   - Results displayed in browser
   - Automatically emailed to hardcoded addresses
   - No access controls on viewing results

### PII Exposure Points
1. **Browser Console:** 11+ locations logging sensitive data
2. **Network Traffic:** Unencrypted API calls (relies only on HTTPS)
3. **Email System:** Sends full evaluation results without encryption
4. **Client-Side Storage:** Auth tokens in localStorage
5. **Third-Party API:** Full transcripts to Anthropic

### Missing FERPA Requirements
1. **No Consent Mechanism:** System doesn't verify consent before processing
2. **No Data Retention Policy:** No automatic deletion of records
3. **No Access Controls:** Once authenticated, users can access any evaluation
4. **No Encryption at Rest:** If data were stored, no encryption mentioned
5. **No Legitimate Educational Interest Verification:** Anyone with token can access

## ðŸ”§ Required Remediation Actions

### Immediate (Critical - Must Fix Now)
1. **Remove ALL console.log statements containing PII**
   ```javascript
   // Remove lines like:
   console.log('handleEvaluate called, transcript:', transcript);
   ```

2. **Implement End-to-End Encryption**
   - Encrypt transcripts before sending to API
   - Use AES-256 or similar for data in transit
