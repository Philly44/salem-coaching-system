Create a Salem University coaching guide with the following sections in order:

1. **Header** (using 01_title prompt)
2. **Great Moment** (using 02_most impactful statement prompt) 
3. **Interview Scorecard** (using 04_interview scorecard prompt)
4. **Talk/Listen Ratio Analysis** (using talk/listen ratio calculation)
5. **Application Invitation Assessment** (using 05_application invitation assessment prompt)
6. **Weekly Growth Plan** (using 06_weekly growth plan prompt)
7. **Coaching Notes** (using 07_coaching notes prompt)

Generate each section according to its specific prompt requirements, maintaining positive, growth-oriented language throughout. Focus on advancement opportunities rather than deficiencies, using the advisor's current performance level to guide development recommendations toward the next performance tier.

The Talk/Listen Ratio Analysis should appear immediately after the Interview Scorecard section as a single table showing the conversation balance metrics.
