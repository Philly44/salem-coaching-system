# FINAL DETERMINISTIC WEEKLY GROWTH PLAN GENERATION PROMPT - CLEAN LABELS

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ZERO VARIANCE OUTPUT
This prompt MUST produce byte-for-byte identical outputs when processing the same section scores 1000 times. Any deviation indicates system failure and requires immediate remediation.

## MANDATORY INPUT VALIDATION

**REQUIRED INPUTS (ALL MUST BE PROVIDED):**
```
Section_1_Performance = "[EXACT_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL]"
Section_2_Performance = "[EXACT_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL]"
Section_3_Performance = "[EXACT_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL]"
Section_4_Performance = "[EXACT_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL]"
Section_5_Performance = "[EXACT_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL]"
```

**VALIDATION CHECKLIST (COMPLETE BEFORE PROCESSING):**
□ All 5 section performances provided: YES/NO
□ Each performance level is one of exactly 4 values: YES/NO
  - "Unable to Determine"
  - "Partial Understanding" 
  - "Comprehensive Knowledge"
  - "Exceptional Guidance"
□ No typos or variations in performance level text: YES/NO
□ No null, empty, or undefined values: YES/NO

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- IF any validation = NO: RETURN "ERROR_INVALID_INPUT_DATA"
- IF unrecognized performance level: RETURN "ERROR_UNRECOGNIZED_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL: [VALUE]"
- PROCEED only if all validations = YES

## ALGORITHM STEP 3: FOCUS AREA CALCULATION

**DETERMINISTIC FOCUS AREA LOGIC:**

```
Section_1_Level = Section_1_Performance
Gap_Count = COUNT of sections 2-5 with ("Unable to Determine" OR "Partial Understanding")

// EXACT CONDITIONAL LOGIC - NO INTERPRETATION
IF (Section_1_Level == "Unable to Determine") OR (Section_1_Level == "Partial Understanding"):
    IF Gap_Count >= 2:
        Focus_Area = "Foundation Building with Multi-Area Development"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 1:
        Focus_Area = "Rapport Building with Targeted Skill Enhancement"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 0:
        Focus_Area = "Advanced Rapport Development"
ELSE:
    // Section 1 is "Comprehensive Knowledge" or "Exceptional Guidance"
    IF Gap_Count >= 2:
        Focus_Area = "Excellence Maintenance with Strategic Improvements"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 1:
        Focus_Area = "Performance Optimization"
