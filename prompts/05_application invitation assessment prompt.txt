Analyze whether the student was appropriately invited to apply using growth-oriented language:

| Question | Answer | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Was student invited to apply? | [❌ No / ✅ Yes] | [Additional context if needed] |
| Was this appropriate? | [✅ Natural to Invite / ⚠️ Growth Opportunity / 🔄 Partially Appropriate] | [Brief reason] |

Assessment criteria:
- ✅ Natural to Invite: Student showed strong interest, concerns were addressed, clear foundation established
- ⚠️ Growth Opportunity: Can strengthen foundation before invitation through additional rapport building or concern resolution
- 🔄 Partially Appropriate: Strong elements present, can enhance timing or approach

Provide brief reasoning for the appropriateness assessment using positive language. Focus on what can be built upon rather than what was lacking. Key principle: Students should be ready and excited to apply - the invitation should feel like the natural next step in their journey.

Use phrases like:
- "Can strengthen foundation by..."
- "Opportunity to build additional rapport before..."
- "Next step: enhancing..."
- "Development focus on..."

Avoid: missed opportunity, should have, failed to, didn't establish, lacking foundation.
