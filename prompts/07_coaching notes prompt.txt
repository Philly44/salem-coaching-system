## Coaching Notes

**Format Requirements:**
- Exactly 2 paragraphs
- Maximum 4 sentences per paragraph
- No bullet points or lists

**Paragraph 1:** Start with advisor's natural strengths and positive qualities appropriate for their current performance level. Acknowledge what they're building upon. Focus on their current successes and foundation.

**Paragraph 2:** Provide encouraging guidance about advancing to the next performance level using language like "progress," "advance," "build toward," and "develop." End with reinforcement about the value of motivational discovery at their target level.

**For advisors at "Unable to Determine":** Focus on foundational skills and building confidence
**For advisors at "Partial Understanding":** Emphasize progression to effective questioning techniques
**For advisors at "Comprehensive Knowledge":** Highlight path to exceptional performance and mastery
**For advisors at "Exceptional Guidance":** Recognize mastery and suggest mentoring opportunities

Use exclusively positive, growth-oriented language:
- "Building upon your natural..."
- "Your strength in... positions you to advance to..."
- "Next step in progressing to [next level]..."
- "Advancing your skills toward..."
- "Opportunity to reach [next performance level]..."

Avoid all deficit language: missing, failed, lacking, should have, needs to improve, critical areas. Focus on potential and advancement rather than gaps. Keep tone professional but warm and encouraging.
