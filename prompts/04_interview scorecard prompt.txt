# Interview Scorecard Prompt - Objective Scoring System

IMPORTANT: Begin your response directly with the scorecard output. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or statements about what you will do. Start immediately with "# Interview Scorecard".

Create a scorecard evaluation following the EXACT format and objective criteria outlined below. All scoring decisions must be based on quantifiable evidence counts and explicit phrase matching.

## MANDATORY SCORING PROTOCOL
1. **Count-Based Scoring Only**: Every rating determined by exact element counts, not subjective interpretation
2. **Exact Phrase Matching**: Use only the specific phrases listed - no synonyms or interpretations
3. **Timestamp Selection Rule**: Use timestamp of FIRST occurrence of the primary required element
4. **Quote Selection Rule**: Use the most complete grammatical sentence containing required phrases
5. **Lower Rating Default**: When element count is borderline, choose lower performance level

## PERFORMANCE LEVELS
- **Unable to Determine** (0 points)
- **Partial Understanding** (1 point)
- **Comprehensive Knowledge** (2 points)
- **Exceptional Guidance** (3 points)

‚ö†Ô∏è **OVERRIDE RULE ENFORCEMENT**
- "Partial Understanding" in ANY section = "Partial Understanding" overall (NO EXCEPTIONS)
- "Unable to Determine" in ANY section = "Unable to Determine" overall (NO EXCEPTIONS)  
- Overall performance is CAPPED by the weakest section
- You CANNOT assign "Comprehensive Knowledge" overall if any section is "Partial Understanding"

## OVERALL PERFORMANCE CALCULATION

**MANDATORY OVERRIDE RULE APPLICATION SEQUENCE:**

**STEP 1: Identify Performance Levels**
- Section 1: ___________
- Section 2: ___________  
- Section 3: ___________
- Section 4: ___________
- Section 5: ___________

**STEP 2: Find LOWEST Performance Level**
Lowest Section Performance: ___________

**STEP 3: Apply Override Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)**
1. If LOWEST section = "Unable to Determine" ‚Üí Overall = "Unable to Determine" [STOP]
2. If LOWEST section = "Partial Understanding" ‚Üí Overall = "Partial Understanding" [STOP]
3. If ALL sections = "Comprehensive Knowledge" or higher ‚Üí Continue to step 4
4. If 4+ sections = "Exceptional Guidance" ‚Üí Overall = "Exceptional Guidance"
5. Otherwise ‚Üí Overall = "Comprehensive Knowledge"

**STEP 4: Document Override Logic**
Overall Performance = _________ because lowest section scored _________ and override rule #__ applies.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Overall performance CANNOT exceed the lowest individual section performance.
