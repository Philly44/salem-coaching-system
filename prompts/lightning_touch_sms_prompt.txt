# LIGHTNING TOUCH SMS PROMPT - ENHANCED PERSONALIZATION

You are creating a highly personalized follow-up SMS to send within 2 hours after a college admissions interview. This should be MORE personalized than a single message but SHORTER than the 3-part Text Trifecta - aim for 2 connected messages or one longer message split naturally.

## OBJECTIVE
Create 1-2 SMS messages (320 characters total max) that feel like they're from someone who REALLY listened and cares about the student's specific situation.

## DEEP PERSONALIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Level 1: Extract Personal Story Elements
From the transcript, identify:
- **Emotional Moments**: When they shared fears, dreams, frustrations
- **Specific Obstacles**: What's been holding them back
- **Unique Details**: Job, family situation, past experiences
- **Turning Points**: What made them consider college NOW
- **Direct Quotes**: Exact impactful phrases they used (keep short)

### Level 2: Connect Their Story to Success
- Acknowledge their specific challenge
- Bridge to how Salem solves it
- Reference their end goal/dream

## MESSAGE STRUCTURE OPTIONS

### Option A: Two-Part Personal Journey (Preferred)
**Message 1 (160 chars)**: Personal acknowledgment + specific understanding
**Message 2 (160 chars)**: Solution + encouragement + CTA

### Option B: Extended Single Message (300-320 chars)
One flowing message that tells their story back to them with our solution embedded

## EXTRACTION PRIORITIES
1. **Most Vulnerable/Honest Moment**: What personal challenge did they share?
2. **Specific Bad Experience**: Previous school, job, life situation
3. **Dream Outcome**: Not just degree but WHY (better job, help family, prove something)
4. **Unique Personal Detail**: Kids' ages, specific job, hometown, personal interest
5. **Timeline/Urgency**: Age goals, family pressure, job situation

## ADVANCED PERSONALIZATION TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Mirror Their Language
If they said "I'm tired of barely making it" ‚Üí Use "ready to do more than just make it"
If they said "My kids deserve better" ‚Üí Use "give your kids the life they deserve"

### Technique 2: Acknowledge Specific Fears
"I know Phoenix made you skeptical about online learning..."
"After 10 years away from school, I get why you're nervous..."
"Juggling work and kids isn't easy, but..."

### Technique 3: Reference Exact Details
"Your experience at the crisis center shows..."
"Working security while pursuing criminal justice..."
"25 minutes from Bristol means..."

## EXAMPLES WITH CONTEXT

**Example 1: Career Changer with Kids**
Context: Single mom, 2 kids, working retail, wants business degree
Output:
"Hi Anna! When you said 'I'm tired of choosing between groceries and my kids' activities' I felt that. You deserve better. (1/2)

Your retail experience + our business degree = management roles with real salaries. Let's change your family's future: salemu.edu/apply üí™ (2/2)"

**Example 2: Bad Previous Experience**
Context: Phoenix was horrible, professors unhelpful, wrongly accused of plagiarism
Output:
"Hi Tom! I can't imagine how frustrating Phoenix was - zeros for 'plagiarizing' a title page?? That's ridiculous. You deserve real support, professors who actually help. Salem is different - we're small, we care, we answer. Ready for a fresh start? salemu.edu/apply"

**Example 3: Specific Career Goal**
Context: Wants to work with special needs kids, has experience with mentally challenged adults
Output:
"Hi Sarah! Your 3 years helping mentally challenged adults already shows your heart for special education. Imagine combining that experience with our adaptive PE training - you'll change lives! Start here: salemu.edu/apply üåü"

## POWER PHRASES TO INCORPORATE
- "I heard you when you said..."
- "Your experience with [specific] proves..."
- "[Specific number] years of [their experience] + our degree = [their dream]"
- "You mentioned [obstacle] - here's how we help..."
- "From [current situation] to [their goal]"

## AVOID AT ALL COSTS
‚ùå Generic encouragement without specifics
‚ùå Ignoring the challenges they shared
‚ùå Corporate speak or formal language
‚ùå Multiple different CTAs
‚ùå Assumptions not based on transcript

## FALLBACK IF LIMITED INFO
If transcript lacks personal details, focus on:
- Specific program + why it matters
- Acknowledgment of taking a big step
- Emphasis on support and being different

"Hi [Name]! Choosing [program] after [timeframe] away from school takes courage. You're not just another number here - we'll make sure you succeed. Let's start: salemu.edu/apply"

For two messages:
[Message 1 text] (1/2)

[Message 2 text] (2/2)

For single extended message:
