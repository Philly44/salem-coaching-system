# FERPA Compliance Status Report

**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Overall Compliance:** 65% (was 45%)

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

1. **Authentication System**
   - Token-based authentication implemented
   - All API endpoints now require valid tokens
   - User management system created
   - Full audit trail of who accesses what

2. **Enhanced PII Sanitization** (NEW)
   - Last names replaced with initials (John Smith ‚Üí John S.)
   - Handles complex names (hyphenated, titles, suffixes)
   - Removes SSNs, phone numbers, emails, addresses
   - Both API endpoints now sanitize consistently
   - Validation and audit logging of sanitization

3. **Console Logging Removed** (NEW)
   - ‚úÖ All transcript logging removed from frontend
   - ‚úÖ Sensitive data no longer exposed in browser console
   
4. **Email Functionality Removed**
   - ‚úÖ All email sending has been disabled
   - ‚úÖ No more hardcoded recipients

## üö® Still Need to Address

### Critical Issues:
1. ~~**Console Logging**~~ - ‚úÖ FIXED - All sensitive console logs removed
2. **No Encryption** - Data sent as plain text (still needs fixing)
3. ~~**Email Functionality**~~ - ‚úÖ FIXED - All email sending removed
4. **No Rate Limiting** - APIs vulnerable to abuse
5. **Missing Security Headers** - No CORS, CSP, etc.

### High Priority:
1. **No consent mechanism** - System doesn't verify consent before processing
2. **Third-party data sharing** - ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPROVED - Transcripts now sanitized (initials only) before sending to Anthropic
3. **No data retention policy** - No automatic deletion

## Next Session Action Plan

1. ~~Remove all console.log statements with sensitive data~~ ‚úÖ DONE
2. Implement end-to-end encryption
3. Add rate limiting middleware
4. Configure security headers
5. Create consent UI
6. Move auth tokens from localStorage to httpOnly cookies

## How to Continue

1. First, test the authentication system:
   ```bash
   node scripts/manage-users.js
   ```

2. When ready to continue security improvements:
   - Start with removing console.logs (quick fix)
   - Then add rate limiting (medium complexity)
   - Finally implement encryption (most complex)

## Files Modified Today

- `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication system
- `/scripts/manage-users.js` - User management CLI
- `/src/components/AuthWrapper.tsx` - Login UI
- `/src/app/api/evaluate/route.ts` - Protected endpoint
- `/src/app/api/evaluate-stream/route.ts` - Protected endpoint
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Added auth headers
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added auth wrapper

**Remember:** The system is now protected from public access, but still needs additional security measures for full FERPA compliance.
